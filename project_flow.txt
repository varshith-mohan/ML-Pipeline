Building Pipeline:

-> Create a Github repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
-> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).
-> Add data, models, reports directories to •gitignore file
-> Now git add, commit, push


Setting up dev pipeline (without params)
-> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
-> dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
-> Now git add, commit, push
